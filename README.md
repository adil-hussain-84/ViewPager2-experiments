# ViewPager2 Experiments

This project houses a number of Android applications which each demonstrate a particular problem of
the [ViewPager2](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/viewpager2/widget/ViewPager2) class or a
workaround for one of the problems.

The applications in this project are as follows:

* [app1](app1) – `FragmentStateAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged()` bug
* [app2](app2) – `FragmentStateAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged()` simple workaround
* [app3](app3) – `FragmentStateAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged()` alternative workaround
* [app4](app4) – `ViewPager2.offscreenPageLimit` bug
